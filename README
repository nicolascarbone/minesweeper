file structure best pratices ?

Backend
    Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
    Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
    Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
    Persistence
    Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
    Ability to support multiple users/accounts


frontend
    Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language,
        of your preference, to the one used for the API
    Detect when game is over (from frontend, using is_bomb element field)
    Time tracking (from frontend, using datetime grid field)

    When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
